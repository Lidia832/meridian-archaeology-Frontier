"""Fixed-format rendering engine for Meridian reports.

This package is the machinery that turns a report's numbers into the
column-exact, banner-topped, paginated printouts the ministry files.  It
knows nothing about crops or forecasts; the report modules in
`reporting.reports` supply the data and the column specs, and this
package renders them.

Sub-modules:
    numfmt   -- per-field numeric/text formatting (right-align, overflow)
    columns  -- Column / ColumnSet: declarative table layout
    banner   -- the letterhead block
    layout   -- pagination, running headers and footers
    emitters -- ReportDocument/Block plus plaintext and CSV emitters

The public surface a report needs is re-exported here so a report can do
`from ..format import Column, ColumnSet, ReportDocument, Block`.
