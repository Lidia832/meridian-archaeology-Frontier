"""Station tables, units and other fixed lore for the reports.

None of this changes at run time.  The station roster is fixed by the
telemetry contract (see docs/CONTRACTS.md): six stations, ids of eight
characters or fewer, space-padded in the wire frame.  We keep the long
names here because the ministry insists the printed reports spell them
out in full -- "GUELPH" on a wire frame, "Guelph" on a printout that a
deputy minister might read.

Originally these lived in a flat text file (STATIONS.DAT) that the
COBOL writer READ at start-up.  When the report writer was rewritten in
Python the table was inlined so there is one less file to lose.
