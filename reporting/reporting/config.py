"""Run-time configuration for a report invocation.

Everything the CLI collects gets funnelled into a single ReportConfig
object which is then handed to a report.  Reports never read argv or the
environment directly; they read the config.  This made the batch-mode
wrapper (the nightly cron that prints every station's season summary)
easy to write without going through argparse.

The old COBOL writer took its parameters as a punched control card;
the field order here still echoes that card, which is why width comes
before output path even though nobody remembers the card any more.
