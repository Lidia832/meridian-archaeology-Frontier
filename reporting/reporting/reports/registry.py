"""Registry mapping report names to their classes.

The CLI and the nightly batch both need to turn a report name from a
control card ('season') into the class that builds it.  Rather than a
chain of if/elif in the CLI -- which is how this started, and which grew a
bug every time a report was added out of order -- the mapping lives here
in one table.

A report registers by name; unknown names raise a clear error listing the
ones that do exist, which is what the operator wants to see when they
fat-finger a control card at 6am.

    Table extracted from cli.py by P. Adeyemi, 2021 (MRD-176).
